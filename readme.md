"Hackerize" words


replace letters with numbers to make words look "techy" but retain their meaning
example:

Dov Rine
D0v R1n3

replace all letter o's with 0
replace all letter i's and l's with 1
replace all letter e's with 3
replace all letter a's with @
replace all letter s's with 5

preserve case

hackerize("replace") --> "h@ck3r1z3"

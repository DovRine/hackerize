# "Hackerize" words


### Replace letters with numbers to make words look "techy" but retain their meaning

examples:

Dov Rine becomes

D0v R1n3

replace all letter o's with 0

replace all letter i's and l's with 1

replace all letter e's with 3

replace all letter a's with @

replace all letter s's with 5

`hackerize("replace") --> "h@ck3r1z3"`
